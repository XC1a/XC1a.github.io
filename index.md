## About Me

I graduated as an M.E. student from Nanjing University ([NJU](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/)).

Before this, I received my B.E. degree in Communication Engineering at Chongqing University ([CQU](https://english.cqu.edu.cn/)).

Now, I keep on researching computer architecture and microarchitecture.
